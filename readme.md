The HTML code is a basic HTML structure for a website, it includes:

The Document Type Declaration (<!doctype html>)
The language of the website (<html lang="en">)
The head section that includes:
Meta tags for character encoding and viewport settings
Link to a stylesheet (<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"/>)
Title of the webpage (<title>Expanding Cards</title>)
The body section that includes:
Five containers (<div class="container">) each with a panel (<div class="panel">)
The panel has a background image set through the style attribute and a header (<h3>)
The end of the body section includes references to three JavaScript libraries: Popper, Bootstrap and a custom script
The CSS code uses @import to bring in a Google font, sets some basic styling for the body of the page such as font family and display properties.

The container and panel classes are used to set up the structure and styling for the expanding cards
The .panel class sets the styling for each card, including the background image, height, border radius, color, cursor, flex value, etc.
The .panel h3 class sets the styling for the header within each card, including the font size, position, opacity, etc.
The .panel.active class sets the styling for the card when it's in an expanded state, increasing the flex value to allow it to take up more space
The media query at the end sets the width of the container and hides two panels on smaller screens
The JavaScript code uses the DOM API to manipulate the HTML elements.

const panels = document.querySelectorAll('.panel') selects all elements with the class panel and stores them in the panels constant
panels.forEach((panel) =>{... iterates over each panel, adding a click event listener to it
The removeActiveClasses function removes the active class from all panels
The panel.classList.add('active') line adds the active class to the panel that was clicked
The rest of the code uses panel.classList to toggle the visibility of the header and other elements in the expanded card.
