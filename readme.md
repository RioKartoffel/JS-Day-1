The HTML file has a basic structure of an HTML document with 5 container divs that each have a panel div within them. The panel divs have a background image, a title, and a background color. The background images are specified using the "style" attribute of the div.

The CSS file styles the HTML document and sets the default font-family, the body display, and other styles for the panels. It also has media queries to adjust the design for different screen sizes.

The JavaScript file uses the querySelectorAll method to select all the panel elements and adds a click event listener to each of them using a forEach loop. When a panel is clicked, it calls a removeActiveClasses function and adds the "active" class to the clicked panel, which expands the panel to take up more space. The function removeActiveClasses is not defined in the code.
